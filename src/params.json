{"name":"Gdis","tagline":"A visualization program for the display, manipulation, and analysis of isolated molecules and periodic structures","body":"GDIS is a scientific visualization program for the display, manipulation, and analysis of isolated molecules and periodic structures. It is in development, but is nonetheless quite functional. \r\n\r\nIt has the following features:\r\n* Support for many common file formats (CIF, PDB, XTL, XYZ, and many more).\r\n* Job submission tools for computational chemistry packages: GAMESS, GULP, ReaxMD, and SIESTA.\r\n* Job analysis and graphing tools for dynamics simulations.\r\n* Useful manipulation tools, including matrix transformations and supercell construction.\r\n* Powerful surface generation and crystal morphology tools.\r\n* Diffraction pattern generation and plotting.\r\n* Animation of multi-frame files.\r\n* Assorted tools for visualization (measurements, ribbons, polyhedral display).\r\n\r\nGDIS also allows you to perform the following functions through other packages:\r\n* Model raytracing (courtesy of [POVRay](http://www.povray.org))\r\n* Movie generation (courtesy of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org))\r\n* Space group processing (courtesy of [SgInfo](http://cci.lbl.gov/sginfo/))\r\n* View the Periodic Table (courtesy of [GPeriodic](http://www.frantz.fi/software/gperiodic.php))\r\n\r\nGDIS has been successfully compiled under Linux, OS X, IRIX, Solaris, OpenBSD, and even Windows.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
