GDIS comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

This is free software. You are welcome to redistribute copies provided the conditions of the GPL (GNU Public License) are met.

Although you are not required to do so, the authors would consider it a courtesy if you submit to them any changes you consider to be worthwhile. The goal would be to keep the development of GDIS more
or less centralized.

Some cool features of GDIS are entirely due to the hard work that has gone into creating the following packages:

1. [CDD](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/fukudak/cdd_home/) for the computation of halfspace intersections (morphology display).
	&copy;Komei Fukuda

2. [GPeriodic](http://www.frantz.fi/software/gperiodic.php) for pretty Periodic Table display and editing.
	&copy;1999 Kyle R. Burton 

3. [SgInfo](http://cci.lbl.gov/sginfo/) for Space Group generator lookup.
	&copy;1994-96 Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve

4. [Brute force symmetry analyzer](http://www.cobalt.chem.ucalgary.ca/ps/symmetry/).
	&copy;1996 S. Pachkovsky 

###Notes

There are a few optional packages that enhance the GDIS experience.

1. For rendering (and subsequent image/movie viewing) you will need:
	- [POVRay](http://www.povray.org)
	- [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org)

2. Although GDIS supports output files from a large number of codes, input files can be created and run within GDIS for:
	- [GULP](http://nanochemistry.curtin.edu.au/gulp/)
	- [GAMESS](http://www.msg.chem.iastate.edu/GAMESS/)
	- [SIESTA](http://departments.icmab.es/leem/siesta/)
